# Advent of Code

This is instructions for answering the Advent of Code puzzles and submitting the answers.

## How to read the puzzle statement

use src.utils.extract_statement to get the puzzle statement.

**Note:** Don't try to read the part 2 statement until you have answered well the part 1.

## How to read the example input

use src.utils.get_example to get the example input.

**Note:** It could be offset sometimes if multiples codes session in html.

## How to submit the answer

Create a folder src/<year>/day_<day> and paste src/template/part_1.py and src/template/part_2.py from /template folder.

Parameter 's' is the input of the puzzle.
Write your code in the code function that return the answer.

Execute the file with uv run src/<year>/day_<day>/part_<part>.py

You have to have a good response at part 1 for answering part 2.
Check the print output to get the status of the submission.

**Note:** If response is not OK, try to use main function with example_or_real=ExampleOrReal.EXAMPLE.

**Note 2:** In exemple mode, you may have to adjust the offset parameter (Depending on the number of example session in html).

## Performance

Consider the performance of the code.
Traitements could be long, you can use numpy or networkx to improve the performance.
