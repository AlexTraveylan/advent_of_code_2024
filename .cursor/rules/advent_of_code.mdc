# Advent of Code

This is instructions for answering the Advent of Code puzzles and submitting the answers.

## How to create the folder structure

Create a folder src/<year>/day_<day> and paste from /template folder:
- src/template/part_1.py
- src/template/part_2.py

## How to read the puzzle statement

use src.utils.extract_statement to get the puzzle statement or execute src/template/statement.py with the day and part as arguments.

**Example:**
```bash
uv run src/template/statement.py 6 1  # day 6 and part 1
```

## How to submit the answer

Parameter 's' is the input of the puzzle.
Write your code in the code function that return the answer.

Execute the file with uv run src/<year>/day_<day>/part_<part>.py

You have to have a good response at part 1 for answering part 2.
Check the print output to get the status of the submission.

**Note:** Don't try to read the part 2 statement until you have answered well the part 1.

**Note 2:** If response is not OK, try to use main function with example_or_real=ExampleOrReal.EXAMPLE.

**Note 3:** In exemple mode, you may have to adjust the offset parameter (Depending on the number of example session in html).

## Performance

Consider the performance of the code.
Traitements could be long, you can use numpy or networkx to improve the performance.
